# [hyperminimal](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hyperminimal)

**Removes the window header from [Hyper terminal](https://hyper.is) for more space and less distraction.**

Before & after:

Also works nicely with tabs, as it only removes the extra title bar:

## How to use

Add `hyperminimal` to `plugins` in `~/.hyper.js`.

### Ubuntu & Elementary

To move the window, simply hold the Super/Windows key and drag it anywhere with the cursor.

### macOS

To move the window, hover over the edge of the window so the resize arrow appears, then drag _perpendicular_ to the direction of the resize arrow. For example, when hovering over the left or right edge, drag vertically instead of horizontally.
